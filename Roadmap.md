## Project Overview

A comprehensive French learning application built with **React** for web and desktop (with possible mobile via React Native) that provides a gamified, AI-powered learning experience for all proficiency levels. This edition leverages Reactâ€™s component model, modern hooks, and ecosystem for rapid, scalable development, while maintaining advanced AI features and integration with Supabase and Groq API.

**Why React for This Project:**

- Best-in-class web performance and SEO
- Massive ecosystem (UI kits, charts, state management, PWA support)
- Rapid prototyping with reusable components
- Easy integration with backend APIs and real-time features
- Excellent support for accessibility and internationalization
- Huge developer pool for future scaling & contributions

**Key Differentiators:**

- AI-powered personalized learning paths
- Real-time conversation practice with AI tutors
- Dynamic content generation based on user progress
- Multi-tier monetization model
- Support for enterprise and educational institutions
- Deep analytics and predictive learning optimization

## Core Features

The core feature set remains as described in the Flutter version, but with a React-first architecture:

1. **AI-Powered Vocabulary Builder** (React flashcards, spaced repetition, image association)
2. **Interactive Grammar Mastery** (Visual grammar, real-time error feedback)
3. **Immersive Listening Practice** (Web audio APIs, accent adaptation)
4. **Advanced Speaking Practice** (WebRTC or cloud STT, AI coach)
5. **Dynamic Reading Comprehension** (AI-curated content, interactive assists)
6. **Intelligent Writing Assistance** (Text editing, collaborative writing)
7. **Cultural Immersion Engine** (WebAR, VR-ready modules)

**Advanced Technical Features:**

- Personalized Learning Engine (ML models via API)
- Real-time Progress Analytics (React dashboards, chart libs)
- Adaptive Content Delivery (Dynamic rendering, session-based adaptation)

---

## Gamification Strategy

2. **Streak Mechanics** (LocalStorage, cloud sync)
3. **Virtual Currency (Francs)** (Marketplace UI, reward logic)
4. **Achievements & Badges** (Icon libraries, user profile integration)
5. **Social Achievements** (Leaderboard, friend challenges)

---

## Proficiency Levels

- **Beginner (A1-A2):** Visual, interactive, bite-sized modules, AR/VR for vocabulary  
- **Intermediate (B1-B2):** Scenario-based, professional vocabulary, debate/discussion  
- **Advanced (C1-C2):** Literary analysis, creative writing, mentor features
